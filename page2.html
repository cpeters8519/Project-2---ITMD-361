  <h1>Reveille Vittetoe Foundation</h1>

  <p>The Reveille Vittetoe Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting and empowering young professionals, students, and community members through scholarships, mentorship, and educational programs. As a board member and Treasurer, I contribute to the foundation's strategic planning and financial stewardship.</p>

  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>The Reveille Vittetoe Foundation aims to aid and empower young people, educators, and families through trauma-informed programs that promote mental health awareness and wellness. By educating about risk factors and warning signs, both visible and subtle, we aim to dismantle the stigma surrounding mental illness. Our goal is to foster connections, facilitate access to vital treatment and support services, and equip teachers and families with the tools to recognize signs of trauma. We are dedicated to fostering open, stigma-free conversations about mental health, ensuring that individuals feel empowered to seek help when they need it most.</p>
