Fundamentals of Web Development Projects

This repository contains coursework from the Fundamentals of Web Development class, taught by Professor Daniel Krieglstein and developed with Dr. Karl Stolley. The course covers foundational web development principles, including client-server architecture, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive design, and modern web standards.

Projects Overview

Project 1: Only HTML

Build three HTML pages: one must be a professional resume; the other two are your choice.

Requirements: raw HTML only (no CSS, tables, or
for layout), proper 2-space indentation, bulleted navigation, at least three images and one media file, directory-based structure, minimum 10 meaningful commits, and W3C HTML validation.

Project 2: Add CSS

Style the Project 1 website with a separate CSS file and optional CSS reset.

Requirements: maintain Project 1 standards, apply at least five shared and five unique style elements per page, horizontal navigation, imported & native fonts, responsive layouts using relative units, and HTML/CSS validation. Creativity beyond minimum style is encouraged.

Project 3: Add JavaScript

Enhance Project 2 with JavaScript and mobile-friendly design.

Requirements: fix previous issues, create one mobile-optimized page with two media queries, add a fourth page with Google Maps API and three custom features, one error-free JavaScript file, and a JavaScript image slider.

Project 4: Foundation Framework

Use Foundation to build a new page from resume content.

Requirements: proper HTML and CSS validation, structured repository, and GitHub Pages deployment.

Each project emphasizes hands-on coding, proper file structure, version control with meaningful commits, validation, and deployment via GitHub Pages. The workflow guides students from static HTML pages to fully styled, interactive, and responsive websites, culminating in using a modern front-end framework.
